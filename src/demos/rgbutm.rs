// this could so easily be a map for a game. different walkers, walkers have rules when they meet certain conditions eg walk on another walkers tile, you die, or swap to going straight
// what about a UTM with made up rules, like from a given colour you set the colour to something and set the tile to something and move in a certain direction. might start getting weird patterns
// seed = r ^ g ^ b or r << 16 | g << 8 | b and dir is khash(seed), head colour is khash(seed) and tile colour is head colour. id expect it to find cycles
// does this look like percolation? percolation looks like a map for a game
// give the walker a tendency to maintain its velocity, or let it move 8ways

// stay clean: every thousand iters reset to start

// allow it to start self organizing, or is there any way of staling shit, or whats the distribution of tiles? or what if just randomized the direction say
// or chance to keep colour the same?


// and whats the fate, one colour?

// or try new rules minimizing number of colour changes

// i guess an oscillator would be good
// how does the size of the colour space change it, getting loops must be crucial

// the thing is that entropy eventually wins, how do you create order. if the rulews change too

// how many states: explicit number? rather than colours
// who will carry the torch of order: cleanup mode engaged if all squares different
// maybe the behaviour is predictable based on the number of states and their relation
// or if multiple states go back to another one

// programs that randomly self modify, you could give it a goal, it could be to withstand bit flips
// or its goal is to replicate, or to replicate and survive bit flips

// could make one that doesnt go backwards to generate one pattern based onsay only its left and up squares

// what about a de noising agent that considers 3x3 and sets it to one of them based on the 3x3

// come on if this had sound
// 8conn interesting?

// what if some structures dont get rewritten

// every 100 back to the start

// option to stay same colour?

// choose the colour its seen the most or the colour its seen the least?

// or if going off the edge teleports you to the middle

// what about certain colours are immutable?
